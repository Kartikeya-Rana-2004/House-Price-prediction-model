# California Housing Price Analysis

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing on the California Housing Prices dataset. The goal is to investigate metrics such as population, median income, and housing location to understand their relationship with median house values.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is sourced via `kagglehub` from the **California Housing Prices** dataset by Cam Nugent. It contains data derived from the 1990 U.S. Census.

**Key Features:**
- `longitude`, `latitude`: Location coordinates.
- `housing_median_age`: Age of the house.
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`: Volume of the house.
- `population`, `households`: Occupancy details.
- `median_income`: Income of the block group.
- `median_house_value`: Target variable (House price).
- `ocean_proximity`: Categorical location (e.g., NEAR BAY, INLAND).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Data splitting (Train/Test).
- **KaggleHub**: Programmatic dataset downloading.
